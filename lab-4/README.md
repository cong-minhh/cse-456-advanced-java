# Payment Processing System

This is a Java application that demonstrates a payment processing system with support for multiple payment methods, following the 3-Layer Architecture and SOLID principles.

## Project Structure

```
src/main/java/vn/edu/eiu/
├── Main.java                    # Entry point (Presentation Layer)
├── service/
│   └── PaymentService.java      # Business logic (Service Layer)
└── payment/
    ├── PaymentMethod.java       # Interface for payment methods
    └── impl/
        ├── CardPayment.java     # Credit/Debit Card implementation
        ├── EwalletPayment.java  # E-Wallet implementation
        └── BankTransferPayment.java # Bank Transfer implementation
```

## Design Patterns and Principles

1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   - `PaymentService` depends on the `PaymentMethod` interface, not concrete implementations.
   - Dependencies are injected through the constructor.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - New payment methods can be added by implementing the `PaymentMethod` interface without modifying existing code.
   - `PaymentService` doesn't need to change when new payment methods are added.

3. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - Each class has a single responsibility.
   - `PaymentService` is only responsible for processing payments, not the details of how each payment is processed.

## Discussion Questions

### 1. Is the layered design as shown in the requirements reasonable? If not, how should it be revised?

The proposed 3-layer architecture is a good starting point, but it can be improved:

1. **Current Structure**:
   - Presentation Layer: `Main` class
   - Service Layer: `PaymentService`
   - Data Layer: `PaymentMethod` implementations

2. **Potential Improvements**:

   a. **Separation of Concerns**:
      - The current design mixes payment processing logic with the entry point.
      - Consider adding a separate controller layer to handle user input and orchestrate between services.

   b. **Dependency Management**:
      - The `Main` class is responsible for creating all dependencies.
      - Consider using a Dependency Injection framework (like Spring) for better dependency management.

   c. **Error Handling**:
      - Add proper exception handling for different types of payment failures.
      - Consider creating custom exceptions for different failure scenarios.

   d. **Logging**:
      - Add logging for better debugging and monitoring.

   e. **Configuration**:
      - Move hardcoded values (like payment details) to configuration files.

3. **Revised Structure Suggestion**:
   ```
   src/main/java/vn/edu/eiu/
   ├── config/           # Configuration classes
   ├── controller/       # REST or MVC controllers
   ├── service/          # Business logic
   │   └── impl/         # Service implementations
   ├── repository/       # Data access layer (if needed)
   ├── model/            # Domain models
   ├── payment/          # Payment processing
   │   ├── dto/          # Data Transfer Objects
   │   ├── exception/    # Custom exceptions
   │   └── impl/         # Payment method implementations
   └── Main.java         # Application entry point
   ```

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Add input validation
   - Implement transaction management
   - Add security measures for sensitive data
   - Include unit and integration tests
   - Add API documentation (if exposing APIs)
   - Consider asynchronous processing for long-running operations

This enhanced structure would make the application more maintainable, testable, and scalable while still following the SOLID principles and clean architecture guidelines.
